# Project Documentation

This documentation provides a concise overview of the modules in this repository and how to build / simulate them.

Modules:

- **DF1** - Basic VHDL components (gates, latch, full adder, FSM)
- **DF2** - Collections of small designs and simulations (BasicLogicGates, FSM_Protocols, IntermediateBlocks)
- **DF3** - FPGA-focused projects (Counter, Decoder)
- **DF4** - AXI4-Lite slave and GPIO (in progress)
- **DV1** - Not found in repository (placeholder)
- **DV2** - FilterDXI demonstration (VHDL filter with test vectors)
- **DV3** - Verification/UVM project
- **CPU0** - RISC-V SystemVerilog CPU core (instruction memory, datapath, control)
- **MAIN** - Not found in repository (placeholder for top-level integration)

Refer to the individual module pages for details, file lists, and instructions.
