# DV1

Status: Not found in repository

Notes & suggested structure:

This repository currently does not contain a `DV1/` directory. If you intend to add a `DV1` module for verification or demonstration, consider the following structure:

- `DV1/`
  - `sources/` — design source files (VHDL/Verilog/SystemVerilog)
  - `simulation/` — testbenches and `modelsim_script.tcl` or `run_*` scripts
  - `docs/` — any module-specific documentation
  - `README.md` — summary, how to run simulations, and expected outputs

Example README content for `DV1`:

- Purpose of the module
- Key files
- How to simulate and expected outputs

If you want, I can scaffold a `DV1/` folder and add a template testbench and README.
