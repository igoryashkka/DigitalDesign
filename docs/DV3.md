# DV3

Description:

`DV3` appears to be a verification-focused directory with scripts and UVM-related or simulation-oriented sources.

Key files:

- `readme.md` — overview of the DV3 project
- `scripts/` — helper scripts to run simulations
- `sources/` — verification / testbench source files
- `uvm_prj.jpg` — diagram or overview image

How to run:

- Inspect `readme.md` and the scripts in `scripts/` to determine the simulator and expected test flow (likely ModelSim or a UVM-capable simulator).

Notes:

- DV3 looks verification-centric and may contain UVM or testbench scaffolding; it’s a good candidate for adding CI checks or scripted regression runs.
